## Installation

```sh
npm i unocss-preset-windblade unocss --save-dev
# or
yarn add unocss-preset-windblade unocss -D
# or
pnpm add unocss-preset-windblade unocss -D
```

## Usage

[Documentation](https://starlederer.github.io/windblade?navigation=/docs) is in development. Until it is complete please follow [Tailwind's docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/aspect-ratio) and refer to our documentation for differences. *You will not have to refer to Tilwind's docs once our own docuentation is complete.*

### Configuring with UnoCSS

Windblade is an UnoCSS preset, please follow its own [guide](https://github.com/unocss/unocss#installation) to install it.

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'unocss'
import presetWindblade from 'unocss-preset-windblade'
import presetVariants from 'unocss-preset-mini-variants' // optional

export default defineConfig({
  presets: [
    presetWindblade({
      // config
    }),
    presetVariants(), // optional
  ],
})
```

### Using proportions

Windblade uses Tailwind's 'spacing' with 't' appended to them + 'screen' units as proportions by default.

```html
<main class="max-size-i-xl">
  <div class="m-10t p-2t"></div>
</main>
```

Since Windblade is so easily customizable it is highly recommended that you change the units to match your design system (please avoid using valid JavaScript numbers as names).

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'unocss'

export default defineConfig({
  extendTheme: [
    ({ windblade }) => {
      // These are the proportions Star uses
      windblade.proportions = {
        's.2': 0.2,
        's.4': 0.4,
        's.5': 0.5,
        's.6': 0.6,
        's.8': 0.8,
        's': 1,
        'm.2': 2,
        'm.4': 4,
        'm.5': 5,
        'm.6': 6,
        'm.8': 8,
        'm': 10,
        'l.2': 20,
        'l.4': 40,
        'l.5': 50,
        'l.6': 60,
        'l.8': 80,
        'l': 100,
      };
    }
  ],
})
```

### Using colors

Windblade comes with a semantic color system. Refer to colors by their names as defined [here](https://github.com/StarLederer/windblade/blob/master/unocss/theme/index.ts) or in your theme.

```html
<div class="bg-normal">
  This will have the 'normal' background
  <div class="bg-accent"> And this will have the 'accent' background </div>
</div>
```

All colors have one or more foreground colors. The first foreground color is set as CSS `color` automatically but you can override it with others or use it for other properties. The foreground colors are updated whenever the `bg` utility is applied.

```html
<div class="bg-normal">
  This will have the 'normal' background and default foreground color.
  <span class="text-fg-2"> And this will have the secondary foreground color </span>
  <div class="bg-fg-2"> <!-- This div has secondary foreground color as background --> </div>
</div>
```

Change color hue by applying `bg-{color name}` together with `sheme-(auto|dark|light)-{number}` or together with `style="--hue: {number}"` (we recommend using the utility, but the CSS variable can be useful if you need to control hue with JavaScript).

```html
<div class="scheme-auto-80 bg-normal"></div>
```

It is a good idea to override the default hue at the root of your app.

```html
<body class="scheme-auto-80 bg-normal">
  ...
</body>
```

### Using Windblade colors in JavaScrtipt

Sometimes you might need to set a color with JavaScript and you might be unable to use a class (e.g. drawing to a canvas). In those situations, you can use Windblade's `core` module.

```js
import { getLCA, LCHToCSSColor } from "unocss-preset-windblade/core";
import { theme } from "unocss-preset-windblade"; // this is just a source file and it does not know about your theme customizations. If you are using your own colors you should import them instead

const brandHue = 80;

getBrandColor((light?: boolean) => {
  const colors = getLCA(theme.windblade.colors['brand'].base); // returns light and dark variants with all values calculated

  let lca;
  if (light) {
    lca = colors.light;
  } else {
    lca = colors.dark;
  }

  let rgb = LCHToCSSColor(lca.l, lca.c, brandHue);

  return `rgb(${rgb.r}, ${rgb.g}%, ${rgb.b}%, ${lca.a}%)`;
});

export default getBrandColor;
```

### Using logical properties

Windblade uses logical properties and values only.

All properties that can be customized on multiple axis/edges/corenrs can be prepended with:
- `-b` for block axis (e.g. `size-b`).
- `-i` for inline axis (e.g. `size-i`).
- `-bs` and `-be` for block start and end edges.
- `-is` and `-ie` for inline start and end edges.
- `-ss` `-se` `-es` `-ee` for corners (start start, start end, end start & end end)

Windblade polyfills logical values so you can use this even where CSS does not support it yet (e.g. `background-position` with `bg-{corner}` utility).

If you are new to logical properties try playing with `bg-gradient-to-{edge/corner}` and see which way the gradient goes.

Please note that `width` and `height` are completely removed in favor of `size-{axis}`.

### Customizing theme

This section explains the options specific to Windblade, for a general guide on how to customize UnoCSS themes see [UnoCSS reamde](https://github.com/unocss/unocss#extend-theme).

#### Colors

Colors in windblade are based on the [HSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) model and have a base (background) and one or more 'on' (foreground) colors.

Add a color by specifying an object like the following:

```js
const theme: Theme = {
  windblade: {
    colors: {
      'mycolor': {
        base: { dark: { s: 0, l: 0 } },
        on: [
          { dark: { s: 0, l: 100 } },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Dark scheme is the default. Lightness is flipped when light color scheme is used.

The HSL color space is not perfect and different hues can look darker or brighter than others. Windblade will switch to a much better [OkLCH](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch) model when browser support improves. For now, Windblade allows you to customize the light mode appearance if your colors need it. This is especially useful with brand and accent colors that should not adapt to color schemes.

It is highly recommended to avoid doing this!

```js
const theme: Theme = {
  windblade: {
    colors: {
      'myColor': {
        base: { dark: { s: 0, l: 0 }, light: { s: 10, l: 90 } }, // slightly more saturated and darker than it would be otherwise in light mode (100 - 0 = 100, we tell it to be 90)
        on: [
          { dark: { s: 0, l: 100 }, light: { a: 80 } }, // more transparent in light mode (80%)
        ],
      },
      'brandColor': {
        base: { dark: { s: 100, l: 60 }, light: { l: 60 } }, // has lightness 60 in both color schemes
        on: [
          { dark: { s: 0, l: 0 } },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Colors can be marked as `interactive`, it will make them respect `highlight` and `highlight+` utilities. This is not always on to avoid extra `calc`s.

```js
const theme: Theme = {
  windblade: {
    colors: {
      'my-interactive-color': {
        base: { dark: { s: 0, l: 0 } },
        on: [
          { dark: { s: 0, l: 100 } },
        ],
        interactive: true,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

#### Proportions

Proportions are used throughout the whole preset for size, duration, opacity, etc.

Proportions are simple numbers that are converted to relevant units automatically (rem is used for sizing).

```js
const theme: Theme = {
  windblade: {
    proportions: {
      'half': 0.5,
      'full': 1,
      'double': 2,
    },
  },
};
```

#### Other customizations

See the [default theme](https://github.com/StarLederer/windblade/blob/master/unocss/theme/index.ts) for other values you can customize.

### WIP: Using calculations

Tailwind allows you to use custom values when your design specification does not fit with their design language. Windblade does not allow that to help you stay within the design language but allows you to do calculations with your proportions right inside CSS.

```html
<div class="p-4t">
  Label
  <!-- Custom underline -->
  <div class="absolute size-i-full size-b-1t inset-bottom-((4t - 1t) / 2)"></div>
</div>
```

### Hover, focus and other states

Windblade does not come with functionality like hover or focus states. Please use Windblade together with [unocss-preset-mini-variants](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unocss-preset-mini-variants) if you need this functionality.
